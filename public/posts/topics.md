If youâ€™ve been wondering what kinds of topics come up in the CCL test â€” donâ€™t stress, Iâ€™ve got you covered. ðŸ˜Œ

According to the official NAATI site, these are the most common areas youâ€™ll hear about in the exam. And because we know how tricky it can be to remember all the right words under pressure, weâ€™ve put together some vocab sheets to help you study smarter (not harder).

Yup â€” theyâ€™re **FREE** to download. Just click on the links and start brushing up on your lingo:

* Business
* Consumer Affairs
* [Employment](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mEmdZ7ghONijTZKuOk792U-RnI8-YTXb/view?usp=drive_link)
* [Health & Medical](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CXO6qyn5Msx72gOc9TCSFT2wxB3qSQLQ/view?usp=drive_link)
* Immigration / Settlement
* Legal
* Community
* Education
* Financial
* Housing
* Insurance
* Social Services

We're working on more â€” so if the topic you need isnâ€™t there yet, hang tight!
Or better yet, shoot me a message and let me know which one youâ€™re after â€” that way I can bump it up the list. ðŸ˜Š
