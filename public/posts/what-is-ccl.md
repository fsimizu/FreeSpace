Okay, so let’s talk about the NAATI CCL Test — aka the Credentialed Community Language test.

Basically, if you can speak English and another language fluently, this is your golden opportunity to boost your points towards your permantent residency. I mean… who doesn’t want 5 extra points and increase the chances of getting invited, right?

So, here’s how it works:

You’ll be given **TWO** pre-recorded dialogues. In each one, you’ll hear a conversation between two people — one speaking English, and the other speaking a LOTE (that’s short for Language Other Than English).

**Your task is to interpret what each speaker says into the other language.**

Each of the two dialogues in the NAATI CCL test is around 300 words — with roughly half in English and half in the LOTE.
These dialogues are split into short segments of no more than 35 words each, making it easier to focus on one part of the conversation at a time.

👉 After each segment, you’ll hear a chime. That’s your cue to start interpreting — either from English into your LOTE or vice versa.

It’s important to begin your interpretation within five seconds of the chime. Long pauses can lead to marks being deducted, especially if your total test time exceeds 20 minutes.

Once you're done speaking, just hit the ‘Finish’ button. If you need to repeat a segment, you can click the ‘Repeat’ button — but keep in mind, you're only allowed to repeat one segment per dialogue without penalties.

You can do an official practice test [here](https://www.naati.com.au/ccl-practice-test/). And hey, I’ve also got some extra practice materials and free dialogues on this site — because I know how tough it can be to find solid prep content that actually helps.

Each dialogue will focus on a different topic based on real-life situations in Australian society. These are designed to test your ability to understand and interpret both languages effectively.

Common topics include:
* Employment 💼
* Health 🏥
* Legal ⚖️
* Education 🎓
* Insurance 🧾
* Social Services 🧑‍💼

If you want to improve your vocabulary for these topics, check out our vocabulary videos — we’ve created exercises to help you get familiar with the most important terms.

#### You've got this! 💪
Practice lots, stay calm, and remember — it’s okay to make small mistakes. The goal is to show you understand both languages and can communicate clearly.
