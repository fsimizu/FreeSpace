### What is the CCL Test?

Are you planning to apply for the points-based PR visa in Australia? 
Did you know that passing the NAATI CCL test can help you earn 5 additional points towards your Skilled Independent Visa?

During the exam, you’ll be asked to interpret two pre-recorded dialogues between two speakers — one is a native English speaker, and the other speaks a LOTE, or Language Other Than English. Your task is to interpret what each speaker says into the other language.

Each dialogue in the NAATI CCL test is around 300 words — with roughly half in English and half in the LOTE, or Language Other Than English.

These dialogues are split into short segments of no more than 35 words each, making it easier to focus on one part of the conversation at a time.

After each segment plays, you’ll hear a chime. That’s your cue to start interpreting what was just said — either from English into your LOTE or vice versa.

It’s important to begin your interpretation within five seconds of the chime. Long pauses can lead to marks being deducted, especially if your total test time exceeds 20 minutes.

Once you finish speaking, click the ‘Finish’ button. If you need to repeat a segment, you can click the ‘Repeat’ button — but keep in mind, you're only allowed to repeat one segment per dialogue without penalties.

Each dialogue will focus on a different topic based on real-life situations in Australian society. These are designed to test your ability to understand and interpret both languages effectively.

Common topics include:
* Employment
* Health
* Legal
* Education
* Insurance
* Social Services
