## Assessment & Penalties

_Do you know how the CCL is assessed?_

&nbsp;

_BY **FREESPACE LEARNING** | 19 MAY, 2025_

NAATI assess CCL tests using a mark deduction method. This means that each test begins with 90 marks (45 per dialog), and marks are taken off if the candidate makes errors during their test. Each error will result in a different number of marks being taken off, depending on how much it impacts on the overall communication.

**To pass the CCL test, you must achieve a score of 63 or more, and at least 29 marks in each dialogue.**
