## Assessment & Penalties

_Do you know how the CCL is assessed?_
_Letâ€™s talk about how the CCL is actually marked â€” so there are no surprises on test day._

Alright, hereâ€™s the deal: the NAATI CCL test is scored using a mark deduction system. This means that you actually start with 90 marks in total (thatâ€™s 45 per dialogue), and then points get taken off for any errors you make along the way.

But donâ€™t panic! Not every slip-up is treated the same. The more an error affects the overall message, the more marks you might lose. So, clarity is key â€” even if your grammar isnâ€™t perfect, just make sure your interpretation gets the meaning across.

**To pass, youâ€™ll need both:**

âœ… A total score of at least **63/90**, and  
âœ… A minimum of **29/45** marks in each dialog.

So even if one dialogue goes really well, make sure you donâ€™t totally bomb the other.
